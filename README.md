## Motivation üí°

The need for a reliable way to store code snippets inspired the creation of Dropcode. In many development environments, it's common to have isolated code snippets that serve specific purposes. However, the ability to store more than one snippet in the same context is often limited. To overcome this, Dropcode introduces the concept of storing files within snippets, enabling more organized and context-rich code management.

## Built With üõ†Ô∏è

Dropcode is built using a combination of modern tools and technologies:
